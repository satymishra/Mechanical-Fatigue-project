## Introduction
Welcome to our Mechanical Fatigue Prediction Project, where we delve into the fascinating world of predicting mechanical fatigue to enhance the safety, reliability, and efficiency of industrial systems.

## Project Overview
Mechanical systems are the backbone of industries, and predicting fatigue accurately is pivotal to ensuring their optimal performance. Our project aims to provide a comprehensive solution to the challenges associated with fatigue prediction. By leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques, we strive to improve the accuracy of predictions, reducing unforeseen failures and enhancing overall system reliability.

## Data
Our project utilizes a carefully curated dataset that includes critical features relevant to mechanical fatigue. The dataset, sourced from [insert source], underwent meticulous preprocessing to handle outliers, missing values, and ensure compatibility with various machine learning algorithms.

## Methods
### Linear Regression
Linear regression serves as a baseline model, allowing us to understand the linear relationships within the data. However, its limitations become evident when dealing with the complex patterns inherent in mechanical fatigue.

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
KNN, a non-parametric method, captures localized patterns in the data. Its application provides insights into the importance of proximity in predicting fatigue behavior.

### CatBoost
CatBoost, renowned for handling categorical data seamlessly, showcases its utility in scenarios where feature types are mixed. The model excels in capturing nuanced relationships within the dataset.

### XgBoost
XgBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, emerges as a robust performer, demonstrating its ability to handle both numerical and categorical features. The ensemble approach, feature importance, and adaptability contribute to its triumph in fatigue prediction.

### LightGBM
LightGBM, a gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning, outperforms other models in terms of efficiency and predictive accuracy. Its ability to handle large datasets and intricate patterns positions it as a top contender in our project.

### Neural Networks
Transitioning to neural networks, we explore the realm of deep learning for fatigue prediction. The architecture, training process, and choice of neural network models are discussed in detail.

## Results
Our results showcase the performance of each model:

- Evaluation metrics, including Mean Squared Error and R-squared.
